Tabs make it easy to switch between different views.

### When To Use

Choerodon UI has 3 types of Tabs for different situations.

- Card Tabs: for managing too many closeable views.
- Normal Tabs: for functional aspects of a page.
- [RadioButton](/zh/cmp/data-entry/radio/#components-radio-demo-radiobutton): for secondary tabs.
